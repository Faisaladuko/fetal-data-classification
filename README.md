Project Topic: Assessing the fetal health to prevent child and maternal mortality Introduction This data was acquired from the Kaggle website(https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification). The multiple preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years old is due to low-resource settings. Countries from around the globe aim to solve this problem. This would help solve many Sustainable Development Goals and thereby save the lives of countless children and their mothers. To enable healthcare professionals to effectively mitigate this problem, technologies such as Cardiotocograms(CTGs) are used to access the health of the fetus. This device generates data from multiple examinations and classifies the health status into three categories which are normal, suspect and pathological.
